Predicting sales based on time series data and data exploration with various visualization techniques.
Overview of the process:
1. Imputing nans with lagged values and forward and backward fills
2. Feature engineering
3. Making pipelines and fitting Linear Regression and Gradient Boost
4. Adding new date-related features
5. Feature selection based on VIF and regularization with L2 norm
6. Fitting new models
7. Fitting a stepwise linear model to see if some other features are unimportant
8. Exploring if there are some non-linear relationships and adding interaction terms to the LR model- better results
9. Feature selection on the GB model using an embedded feature selector to select features
10. Hyperparameter tuning for GB using GridSearch
